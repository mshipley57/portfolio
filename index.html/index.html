            <p>Hi there, my name is Mariah Shipley, thank you for finding my page and taking a little bit of time to read about me. I was born in Portland, Oregon and have lived in the Portland Metropolitan area for most of my life, though for small portion I did live in North Idaho. Presently I live in Beaverton with my husband James and our rescued pomeranian, Ramone. For fun the three of us go on long walks in the area. We have a great time together whether we're exploring new trails, or watching movies with hot cocoa. So there you have it, there's a little about me.</p>
